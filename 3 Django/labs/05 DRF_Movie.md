# Movie DRF Lister

#### Make an app using DRF that allows a collection of movies and information on them
#### Store in the movie model more than just the title. Think of what a website would store on a movie and reflect that data in the model. Have in your model values such as Title, Genere, Release Date, Meta Score

#### Using Vue3 on the frontend, be able to add a movie and see all movies in the database
#### After you get basic functionality, style the page thematically.
