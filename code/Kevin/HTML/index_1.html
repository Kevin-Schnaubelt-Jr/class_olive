        <h1>The Church of Vows</h1>

        <br>

        <h2>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Church of Vows was constructed to commemorate the marriage of Lord Radagon and Lady Rennala, and is situated
            in view of the major monuments of either house; the Erdtree, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Lord Radagon and Lady Rennala
            met as enemies during Lord Radagons conquest of Liurnia, the continent in which the Academy of Raya Lucaria resides. So smitten was
            Lord Radagon by Lady Rennala that he ceased his territorial aggressions and became husband to the Carian Queen. And so
            the Church of Vows remains a symbol of peace between the great houses.
        </p> 
        <br>
        <p>The church is currently tended by Miriel, Pastor of Vows, who educates and assists travelers with absolution. 
            Visitors merely need to offer Celestial Dew, as Lord Radagon once did, to the statue of Lady Rennala as an offering of peace
            to those they may have spurred, and in attempt to mend relations.
        </p>
