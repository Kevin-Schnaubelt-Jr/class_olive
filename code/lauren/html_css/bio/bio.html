    <p>Tori kelly is an American singer and songwriter from Wildomar, California. 
        She got her start in music at a young age and was known as Americas most talented kid. 
        In 2010 she tried out for American Idol but never got into the top 24 but this only fueled a fire under her to keep persuing music as she believed in herself.
        Tori then started writing her first EP called "Handmade songs by Tori Kelly" which was released by her own label. After her success with that album, Tori started recording 
        youtube videos which allowed for even more exposure and this is where her career really took off. Ever since her 
        youtube success, she has seen even more with her albums you can see listed below. Although she is most known
        for being a gospel artist, she can truly sing any style with ease.
